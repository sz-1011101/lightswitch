Lightswitch, a software raytracer
---------------------------------
This is my software raytrace written in C++ for educational purposes. Right now it can only render spheres. 
I plan to extend it with more features.
Also beware that this software most likly contains bugs and code which needs optimization.

The SDL2 library is used to display the results.

The glm libraty is used to do the internal math.
